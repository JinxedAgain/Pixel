When the message is sent the users have 3 Reaction Options to choose from:
✅ Check Mark: Dms your Friend letting them know that you completed the task
❌ No: Option to DM Friends Letting them know that you did not complete the task that day.
⌛ Hourglass: Promps the user when they would like to be reminded again later in the day.
